# ARDUINO-SERIAL-MONITOR-with-MIDI-baud-rate-31250
ARDUINO serial monitor working with 31250 baud for easy debuging while writing MIDI scetchs
I'm using a siliconLabs CP2102 USB to TTL converter.
Normaly this device can not solve the MIDI baud rate but there is an easy to use configuration tool @ the silicon labs page,
called 'Simplicity Studio'. Istall it and you can change the baud rate from 38400 to 31250, it's just a click and it's done.
When ever you like to have a MIDI MONITOR within ARDUINO, just set the ARDUINO serial monitor to 38400.
It's that easy.
